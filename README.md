StockGrabber-TestScript
=======================
This is a quick script I did for my dad over Christmas 2013 which grabs stock information from various sources and exports them to a csv.

I have since moved everything over to a nodejs project located here: https://github.com/brelloch/StockGrabber-Site

Docker run: docker build -t stockgrabber .; docker run --rm -it stockgrabber;
